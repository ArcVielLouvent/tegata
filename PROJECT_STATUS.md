# Project Status — Tegata

> This file is the project's "memory" that travels with the repo. Every new work session should start by reading this file, not by assuming.

**Last updated:** 2026-08-21 (Phase 0 complete)
**Hackathon deadline:** September 3, 2026, 10:00 PDT
**Target:** Foxit, Xano, Doctavian tracks + Overall Winner (DevNetwork [API+Cloud+AI] Hackathon 2026)

## Concept Summary
See `docs/tegata-concept.md` for the full spec. In short: a time-boxed access authorization system where the LLM only proposes (NLU front-door), the system (hard schema validation + Xano) decides, Doctavian assembles a risk-scored conditional document, Foxit provides the two-way signing + verification layer, and everything auto-expires with a permanent audit trail.

## Phases Completed
- [x] Phase 0 — Repo Foundation
- [ ] Phase 1 — Risk Engine + State Machine
- [ ] Phase 2 — Conditional Document
- [ ] Phase 3 — Signature & Verification
- [ ] Phase 4 — AI Front-Door
- [ ] Phase 5 — Auto-Expire & Audit Trail
- [ ] Phase 6 — Frontend Demo
- [ ] Phase 7 — Stretch Features
- [ ] Phase 8 — Documentation & Submission

## Decisions Already Locked In (do not change without a strong reason)
- Stack: Python (agent/NLU) + Next.js/TypeScript (frontend) + Xano (backend/BaaS) + Foxit (e-sign) + Doctavian (documents)
- Core principle: what the human signs is exactly what the machine executes (no hidden payload)
- Two-pass LLM (extraction → self-check) followed by a hard schema gate — the LLM only proposes
- Testing: unit tests per phase + Playwright for frontend e2e
- Issue tracking: 1 issue per phase via `scripts/phase-sync.sh`, one branch per phase, CI per branch
- Project name: Tegata (final)
- All deliverables (README, docs, code, submission) in English — this is an international hackathon, not a national Indonesian one

## What Phase 0 Actually Built
- `packages/schema/tegata.schema.json` — canonical JSON Schema (single source of truth for data shapes)
- `packages/schema/python/models.py` — Pydantic models mirroring the JSON Schema, tested working
- `packages/schema/ts/schema.ts` — Zod schemas mirroring the same JSON Schema, tested working
- `tests/test_schema_consistency.py` + `tests/schema_consistency.test.ts` — cross-language tests that fail on purpose if Python/TS/JSON schema ever drift apart. These already caught one real bug during Phase 0 build (the `used` field was incorrectly marked required in the JSON Schema; fixed).
- `apps/agent/pyproject.toml` + `requirements.txt` — Python project config with ruff lint rules
- `packages/schema/ts/package.json` + root `package.json` (pnpm/npm workspace) — Node project config
- `.env.example` — placeholders for all sponsor + LLM credentials, none filled in yet
- `.gitignore` — covers secrets, node_modules, Python caches
- `scripts/phase-sync.sh` — tested against a mock `gh` CLI (start creates+labels an issue idempotently, done closes+relabels it, status prints a table). Not yet run against the real GitHub repo.
- `.github/workflows/phase-0.yml` — lints + runs both schema consistency test suites
- `.github/workflows/phase-issue-sync.yml` — auto-marks an issue in-progress on push to a `phase/N-*` branch, and done when that branch's PR merges to `main`. Branch-name-to-phase-number extraction regex tested against multiple cases.

## Not Yet Done / Known Gaps
- No actual application code yet (agent NLU, Xano calls, Foxit/Doctavian integration) — that starts at Phase 1.
- `phase-sync.sh` has not been run against a real GitHub repo/`gh` CLI yet — only against a mock. First real run should be watched closely.
- Sponsor credentials (Xano, Foxit, Doctavian) not yet requested — do this at the start of Phase 1/coding, not before (see README table).

## Notes for the Next Session
Phase 0 is done and tested. Start Phase 1 (Risk Engine + State Machine) next — see ROADMAP.md for exact scope and done-when criteria. Register for Xano and email Foxit/Doctavian for credentials at the start of that phase.
